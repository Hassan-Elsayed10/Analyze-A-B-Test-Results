## A/B Test Analysis Project

### Analyzed A/B test results for an e-commerce website to help determine whether a new page design should be implemented or the old one should be kept.
# Utilized statistical methods, including probability, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis, to interpret data and provide actionable insights.
# Applied knowledge of A/B testing to assess the effectiveness of the new page and offer recommendations for potential improvements or further testing.
